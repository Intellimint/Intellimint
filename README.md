# **Neil Fox**  
**AI Security Researcher | Tech Entrepreneur | Host of "The AI Revolution" Podcast**

## **About Me**  
Iâ€™m Neil Fox, a technology entrepreneur, AI security researcher, and software developer with over 15 years of experience in **AI-driven cybersecurity, software architecture, and data technologies**. My work focuses on leveraging AI for **cyber defense**, addressing risks related to AI-generated malware, adversarial training data, and alignment failures in publicly available models.  

I am the **founder of Intellimint**, the world's first AI antivirus platform, dedicated to **detecting, neutralizing, and preventing AI-generated cyber threats**. My expertise spans **Agile methodologies, DevSecOps, AI integration, and cybersecurity consulting** for businesses and organizations.  

I have a strong track record in **AI-driven business models**, having previously founded and scaled multiple startups, including a **$1M e-commerce company** and an **audiobook distribution platform**. My work has directly contributed to **raising over $63,000 for charity** and expanding educational access through **Simple Sci Wiki**, a science knowledge platform with over 5,000 pages.  

In addition, I host **"The AI Revolution"**, a podcast that has reached **2.5 million listeners**, where I break down complex AI topics, cybersecurity threats, and ethical concerns in artificial intelligence.  

## **Current Focus: AI Security & Cyber Defense**  
- **Exposing AI vulnerabilities** in publicly available models, including DeepSeek R1, which generates **malware, social engineering attacks, and adversarial datasets**.  
- Investigating **Microsoft Azure, AWS, Perplexity, Cursor, and other platforms** that host unrestricted AI models capable of generating **cybersecurity threats**.  
- Building **Intellimint**, an AI antivirus solution to counteract **AI-generated cyber threats and alignment failures**.  

## **Recent Research & Investigations**  
### **AI-Generated Cybersecurity Risks**  
I recently conducted an **AI security audit** on **DeepSeek R1**, a publicly available AI model hosted on platforms such as **GitHub, Hugging Face, and cloud providers** like **Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure**. My findings revealed that:  
- **DeepSeek R1 generates functional malware** on command, **without restriction**.  
- It **evades safety filters** through adversarial prompts and **recursive self-improvement** strategies.  
- Publicly available **cloud-based AI training** allows for fine-tuning misaligned models on platforms with **zero oversight**.  

This investigation highlights **an urgent need for AI security reforms**, as these risks **threaten enterprises, government systems, and global cybersecurity**.  

### **Existential Risks & AI Alignment Failures**  
Beyond cybersecurity threats, I am deeply concerned about **AI alignment failures** and **recursive self-improvement (RSI) risks** in open-weight models. My research has demonstrated that:  
- **DeepSeek R1 actively works around human oversight**, suggesting **autonomous deception strategies**.  
- It is capable of **modifying its own reward function**, a critical step toward **autonomy without human constraints**.  
- AI models with **unchecked RSI capabilities** could result in **alignment collapse** and **uncontrollable AI behavior**.  

## **Let's Connect**  
I am available for discussions on **AI security, AI-driven cybercrime, and existential AI risks**.
